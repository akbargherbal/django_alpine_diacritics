I'm working on a learning project to build an Arabic text diacritization web application. As a Python developer with 5+ years of experience but limited front-end knowledge (<1 year), I'm using Django for the backend and AlpineJS for the front end. My approach prioritizes keeping JavaScript code minimal while achieving necessary real-time interactivity.
The application's core purpose is to enable fast, streamlined addition of diacritical marks (تشكيل) to Arabic text. The backend (Django) serves pre-structured HTML with comprehensive data attributes, while the front end (AlpineJS/JS) handles essential real-time interactions like keyboard navigation and diacritic insertion. The project currently uses keyboard shortcuts for efficiency (e.g., Ctrl+Space for word navigation, Space for character navigation, number keys for diacritics).
My development preferences are:
1. Keep JavaScript minimal - use frameworks/libraries (AlpineJS, hotkeys-js) to reduce custom JS code
2. Leverage Django's capabilities - generate complex structure and data attributes server-side
3. Focus on essential real-time interactions that can't be handled by the backend
4. Take an iterative approach to adding features
5. Maintain clean separation between backend and frontend responsibilities
Please keep these preferences in mind when suggesting solutions or improvements. While optimization is welcome, the primary goal is learning and maintaining code clarity rather than achieving maximum performance.
